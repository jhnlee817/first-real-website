                The Grim Reaper's first apprentice. Due to modern medical care causing a decline in the reaping 
                business, Calliope decided to become a VTuber to harvest souls instead. It seems that the 
                ascended souls of the people who are vaporized by the wholesome interactions between VTubers 
                go to her as well. That being said, despite the image her hardcore vocals and manner of speech 
                gives off, she's actually a gentle-hearted girl who cares greatly for her friends.

                reborn from her ashes anyway.

                Amelia heard strange rumors online surrounding hololive: talking foxes, magical squirrels, 
                superhuman dogs, and more. Soon after beginning her investigation on hololive, and just out 
                of interest, she decided to become an idol herself! She loves to pass her time training her 
                reflexes with FPS games, and challenging herself with puzzle games. "It's elementary, right?"

                Despite her looks, Ina'nis is actually a priestess of the Ancient Ones. One day, she picked up a 
                strange book and then started to gain the power of controlling tentacles. To her, tentacles are 
                just a part in her ordinary life; it has never been a big deal for her. However, her girly mind 
                does want to get them dressed up and stay pretty. After gaining power, she started hearing 
                Ancient Whispers and Revelations. Hence, she began her VTuber activities to deliver random 
                sanity checks on humanity, as an ordinary girl.
